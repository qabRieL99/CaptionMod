Once the game plays a .wav file, it will scan the dictionary with the sound path (without sound/ prefix),
The subtitle will display if an entry was found in the dictionary.

## 2.By playing SENTENCE

see gamedir\sound\sentences.txt

for example, HG_GREN0 is a SENTENCE, the subtitle will display once a SENTENCE is played and the name of it was found in the dictionary.
